discussion of the conclusions, and recommendations for practice and for further research.

\section{Summary}

Cryosphere fed irrigation networks are completely dependant on the timely availability of meltwater from
glaciers, snow and permafrost. With the accelerated decline of glaciers, these irrigation networks can no longer
deliver adequate water to sustain agricultural output and take advantage of the complete growing season. As a
consequence, some mountain villages have either been abandoned or lie on the brink of desertification
\cite{grossmanHimalayanGlaciersMelt2015}.

In the past few decades, artificial ice reservoir (AIR) technologies have provided much needed relief to these
water-stressed communities. These strategies revolve around augmenting their glacial ice reservoirs with
man-made ones that provide supplementary irrigation during the spring. In the context of the observed present
and predicted global glacier shrinkage, the development of such water storage technologies is crucial to ensure
continued survival of mountain communities.

Published AIR observations and investigations date back to the mid-2000s \cite{tveitenGlacierGrowingLocal2007}.
The vast majority have been published in the 2010s, mostly using qualitative methods. Published quantifications
of their storage capacity differ widely \citep{baglaArtificialGlaciersHelp1998, norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015,
nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}.

We attempt to address this gap through a quantitative study on AIRs. With a special focus on ice stupas, a mass
and energy balance model was developed and used as a tool to quantify the influence of meteorological conditions
and fountain characteristics. Because small-scale processes, complex feedbacks and non-linearities govern their
evolution, modelling the volume evolution of ice stupas is only feasible if backed up with comprehensive input,
calibration and validation datasets.

In response, we conducted measurement campaigns using drones, flowmeters and weather stations on almost a dozen
AIRs across two locations (India and Switzerland), over four winters (2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022) and using two
different construction methods (traditional and automated). Each dataset contained information on the
meteorological conditions, fountain characteristics and AIR shape evolution. The
meteorological and fountain observations were used as model input; AIR shape evolution observations were used to
calibrate the model parameters and validate its ice volume estimations.

The model has been shown to perform excellently when calibrated with the AIR datasets.  It could be shown that
the maximum volume of AIRs located in the IN and CH regions differ by an order of magnitude. These differences
were caused by the stronger sublimation process due to the colder and drier weather conditions of the IN region. 

AIR maintenance requirement was reduced and their fountain freezing events were prevented by developing an
automated construction strategy. Fountain operation was made 8 times more efficient and effortless through the
use of an automation system that scheduled discharge rates based on the recommendations of the AIR model. 

\section{Conclusions}

The main objective of this thesis was to improve our understanding about the response of AIRs to changes in
their construction location and fountain characteristics. In a first experiment, the evolution of AIRs in
Indian Himalayas and the Swiss Alps are compared. The model results show: 

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Icestupa's maximum volume can vary by an order of magnitude due to meteorological
  conditions of their construction location. 

\item Icestupa fountain systems spray five times more water than required.

\end{enumerate}

In a second experiment, the evolution of AIRs using different fountain scheduling strategies are compared. The
model results show: 

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Weather-sensitive fountain systems increase AIR water-use efficiency 8 fold.

\item Weather-sensitive fountain systems enable maintenance-free AIR construction.

\end{enumerate}
