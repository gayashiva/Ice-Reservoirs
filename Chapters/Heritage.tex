as well as discussion and recommendations for future research. This Chapter will review the purpose of the
study, research questions, literature review, and findings of the study. It will then present conclusions,
discussion of the conclusions, and recommendations for practice and for further research.

\section{Summary}

Cryosphere fed irrigation networks are completely dependant on the timely availability of meltwater from
glaciers, snow and permafrost. With the accelerated decline of glaciers, these irrigation networks can no longer
deliver adequate water to sustain agricultural output and take advantage of the complete growing season. As a
consequence, some mountain villages have either been abandoned or lie on the brink of desertification.

In the past few decades, artificial ice reservoir (AIR) technologies have provided much needed relief to these
water-stressed communities. These strategies revolve around augmenting their glacial ice reservoirs with
man-made ones that provide supplementary irrigation during the spring. In the context of the observed present
and predicted global glacier shrinkage, the development of such water storage technologies is crucial to ensure
continued survival of mountain communities.

Because small-scale processes, complex feedbacks and non-linearities govern their evolution, accessing the
response of AIRs to the location and fountain chosen is challenging and only feasible if backed up with
comprehensive field data. However, empirical data and studies focussing on AIRs are sparse.

A measurement campaign was performed using drones, flowmeters and weather stations on almost a dozen AIRs across
two locations (India and Switzerland), over four winters (2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022) and using two different
construction methods (traditional and automated). The corresponding datasets were codenamed with the prefix of
the country, the suffix of the winter season and the construction  method used (eg. Traditional CH21 AIR ). AIR
radius, area and volume were recorded using DEMs produced from drone flights. The fountain characteristics were
calibrated from the observed radius and discharge rates. The model parameters were calibrated from some volume
observations. The rest of this DEM dataset were used to validate the modelled volume evolution. This provided a
unique data basis for quantifying the feasibility and potential of this water storage technology worldwide.

Physical models provide unbiased insight into the physical processes and the drivers of temporal and spatial
changes. With a special focus on icestupas, here defined as vertical AIRs, a mass and energy balance model was
developed and used as a tool to quantify the influence of meteorological conditions and fountain
characteristics.  The model has been shown to perform excellently when calibrated with field data.  It could be
shown that the maximum volume of AIRs located in the IN and CH regions differ by an order of magnitude. The
differences can be attributed to the stronger sublimation process due to the colder and drier weather conditions
of the IN region. 

AIR maintenance requirement was reduced and their fountain freezing events were prevented by developing an
automated construction strategy. This improved construction strategy made fountain operation weather-sensitive
through the use of an automation system that scheduled discharge rates based on the recommendations of the AIR
model. The automated construction strategy was successful in making AIRs using 87 \% less water while being
maintenance-free.

\section{Conclusions}

The main objective of this thesis was to improve our understanding about the response of AIRs to changes in
their construction location and fountain characteristics. In a first experiment, the evolutional of AIRs in
Indian Himalayas and the Swiss Alps are compared. The model results show: 

\begin{itemize} 

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Icestupa's maximum volume can vary by an order of magnitude due to meteorological
  conditions of their contruction location. 

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Icestupa fountain systems spray five times more water than required.

\end{itemize}

In a second experiment, the evolution of AIRs using different fountain scheduling strategies are compared. The
model results show: 

\begin{itemize} 

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Weather-sensitive fountain systems increase AIR water-use efficiency 8 fold.

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Weather-sensitive fountain systems enable maintenance-free AIR construction.


\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}

\begin{itemize} 

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Colder, drier and less cloudy construction locations form long-lasting AIRs with
  higher maximum ice volumes. 

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Weather-sensitive fountain systems produce larger and efficient AIRs effortlessly. 

\end{itemize}

\section{Suggestions for future research}

\begin{itemize} 

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Identification of favourable locations.
