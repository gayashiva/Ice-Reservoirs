These AIRs are constructed as close
to the villages as possible. Being at a lower altitude than the natural glaciers, AIRS begin melting in April,
providing irrigation just in time for the start of the agricultural season.


A spirit of improvisation guides the design and construction of AIRs making it difficult to make a quantitative
comparison from site to site.

The construction of ice terraces on south-facing slopes is regarded not only as a way to cope with water
scarcity but also as an adaptation to climate change \citep{norphelArtificialGlacierHigh2009}.

AIRs are engineered systems exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of
ice.

Adequate crop production assumes a central role in the lives of mountain farmers, making the availability of
irrigation water indispensable. The chief components of that resource are meltwater from glaciers and seasonal
snow cover. However, seasonal melting of glaciers occurs quite late because of the regions's high altitude,
which delays the availability of glacial meltwater. This seasonal water scarcity makes it essential to provide
supplementary irrigation in order to take advantage of the complete growing season. 

Modelling is a powerful tool that allows to identify the causes of AIR volume dynamics in space and time.
However, in-situ observations are required to tie these models to reality.  

In this thesis a one dimensional model has been developed which is used as a tool to investigate the dynamics of
AIRs.

The ice volume dynamics due to the difference in weather patterns of the Swiss location and Indian
location can be summarised as follows: 

 It is not known who started the practice of glacier grafting, but according to oral history it is as old as the
local communities.
