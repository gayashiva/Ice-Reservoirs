  abstract = {Mountains are a critical source of water. Cryospheric and hydrological changes in combination with socio-economic development are threatening downstream water security triggering the need for effective adaptation responses. Here, we present a global systematic review (83 peer-reviewed articles) that assesses different water-related stressors and the adaptation responses to manage water stress in major glaciated mountain regions. Globally, agriculture (42\%), tourism (12\%), hydropower (8\%) and health and safety (4\%) are among the main sectors affected by hydrological and cryospheric changes . A broad set of adaptation measures has already been implemented in the world's mountain regions. We find that globally the most commonly used adaptation practices correspond to the improvement of water storage infrastructure (13\%), green infrastructure (9.5\%), agricultural practices (17\%), water governance and policies (21\%), disaster risk reduction (9.5\%) and economic diversification (10\%). Successful implementation of adaptation measures is limited by reduced stakeholder capacities, collaboration and financial resources, and policies and development. To overcome these limitations, funding for climate change adaptation and development programmes in mountains and trust-building measures such as shared stakeholder activities need to be strengthened. Local awareness raising of both, the adverse effects of climate change and potentially positive implications of specific adaptation measures can help to support successful adaptation.},

  abstract = {Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean square error within 18               \%               of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.},

  abstract = {In a changing climate, river basins with limited summer precipitation but abundant snow and glacier melt-water are affected severely by reductions and seasonal alterations in annual stream flows. However, high altitude glacio-hydrological observations and investigations to address the linkage between the timing of glacier changes and river runoff fluctuations remain ambiguous, particularly in the northwestern Himalayan region of Pakistan. In this context, the hydrological regime of the Astore Basin, a sub-catchment of the Upper Indus River Basin, was comprehensively investigated by employing in situ hydro-meteorological observations in combination with satellite remote sensing data. Two-thirds of the annual precipitation in the Astore Basin falls in winter and spring, mainly deposited by westerly winds, whereas summer and autumn precipitation deposited by the monsoon and local jet streams accounts for only one-third. Some 14~\% of the basin area is covered by glaciers and, added to the accumulated seasonal snow deposited by westerly circulations, this can reach 80\textendash 85~\% of the basin area. Therefore more than 75~\% of the annual basin runoff depends on melt-water produced by the predominant seasonal snow and glacier ablation. The non-parametric Mann\textendash Kendall trend test was applied to the whole time-series of hydro-meteorological data. This indicated a lowering of annual and summer mean temperatures during the period 1980\textendash 1995 and slight warming during the 1996\textendash 2010 period. Similarly, annual, winter and summer precipitation, and annual mean discharge, increased from 1980 to 1995 but, in contrast, a slight decrease in annual and summer precipitation was observed during the 1996\textendash 2010 period; however, discharge evidence is slight making any increase in this period insignificant. In addition, the Spearman and Mann\textendash Kendall correlation results depict annual stream flow fluctuations during the 1980\textendash 2010 decades in the Astore River that were predominantly influenced by precipitation variations, but not by any alteration in catchment temperatures, and so not governed by enhanced glacier ablation and retreat. The results of the analysis presented here were also substantiated by satellite remote sensing investigation, which points to evidence of stable conditions in the Astore Basin glaciers during this period.},

For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas. Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world's most important and vulnerable water towers.},

  abstract = {The hydrograph separation method, previously proposed to quantify base flow, seasonal snowmelt, and glacial melt components in river flows within Upper Indus basin underestimates glacial melt component. This is particularly limiting for highly glacierized watersheds. The limitation has been corrected by a further refinement of the method. The results with the refined procedure are highly consistent with the physical characteristics such as hypsometry and glacier extents of the watershed even though the method itself is completely independent of the physical characteristics of the watershed where it is applied. Glacial melt far outweigh snowmelt in the rivers draining the Karakoram and Zanskar ranges. In the Karakoram, on an annualized basis, glacial melt proportion varies from 43\% to 50\% whereas snowmelt varies from 27\% to 31\%. On the other hand, snowmelt dominates over glacial melt in the rivers draining the western Greater Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. Here snowmelt percentage in river discharge varies from 31\% to 53\% whereas that of glacial melt ranges from 16\% to 30\%. In the main stem of Upper Indus River, snowmelt fraction in most cases is slightly greater than the glacial melt fraction. In the main stem, snowmelt percentage ranges from 35\% to 44\% whereas glacial melt percentage ranges from 25\% to 36\%. Upper Indus River just upstream of Tarbela Reservoir carries annual flows constituted of 70\% melt water of which 26\% is contributed by glacial melts and 44\% by snowmelts. We also show that during the later part of twentieth century and continuing into the early part of twenty first century glacial melt contributions to river discharge has decreased compared to the previous decades. This phenomenon can be ascribed to either basin wide loss of glacial mass in the recent decades in the elevation range from where most of the glacial melt originates or glacier growth and stability due to either reduction in energy inputs or increase in precipitation or both at the high altitude bands wherefrom glacial melt water originates.},

The system of water distribution during the farming season is strictly followed by the people in their respective villages. Artificial glacier technique is used in the area from 1987. The main stream water is diverted by constructing a long channel made of dry stonewall across the hill slopes to the glacier site. The length, breadth and depth of the channel vary with the slope of the hill as well as an estimated flow of the stream. Dry stone retaining walls and a suitable bed grade to smoothen the follow of water protect the channel from damage. The stone wall is made of locally available stone and a mix of organic manure and soft soil. The technology of the artificial glacier has been in operation in the area for 15 years and is performing successfully.},

  abstract = {Glacier changes are a vivid example of how environmental systems react to a changing climate. Distributed surface mass balance models, which translate the meteorological conditions on glaciers into local melting rates, help to attribute and detect glacier mass and volume responses to changes in the climate drivers. A well-calibrated model is a suitable test bed for sensitivity, detection, and attribution analyses for many scientific applications and often serves as a tool for quantifying the inherent uncertainties. Here, we present the open-source COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon (COSIPY), which provides a flexible and user-friendly framework for modeling distributed snow and glacier mass changes. The model has a modular structure so that the exchange of routines or parameterizations of physical processes is possible with little effort for the user. The framework consists of a computational kernel, which forms the runtime environment and takes care of the initialization, the input\textendash output routines, and the parallelization, as well as the grid and data structures. This structure offers maximum flexibility without having to worry about the internal numerical flow. The adaptive subsurface scheme allows an efficient and fast calculation of the otherwise computationally demanding fundamental equations. The surface energy balance scheme uses established standard parameterizations for radiation as well as for the energy exchange between atmosphere and surface. The schemes are coupled by solving both surface energy balance and subsurface fluxes iteratively such that consistent surface skin temperature is returned at the interface. COSIPY uses a one-dimensional approach limited to the vertical fluxes of energy and matter but neglects any lateral processes. Accordingly, the model can be easily set up in parallel computational environments for calculating both energy balance and climatic surface mass balance of glacier surfaces based on flexible horizontal grids and with varying temporal resolution. The model is made available on a freely accessible site and can be used for non-profit purposes. Scientists are encouraged to actively participate in the extension and improvement of the model code.},
